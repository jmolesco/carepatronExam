For .net core
There are some changes I made into the ClientRepo as I think those are needed. The exam is not that hard since template is already there, I just need to read the codes. I was able to finish this in an hour since this is just a minor app with CRUD Operations. For me next thing to do is to implement a wider validation thru the used of FluentValidationBtw, I have used swagger so the url is different.

For UI,
For me this is challenging in a sense that I dont have any knowledge on react typescript but I was able to finish this thru the guidance of Stackoverflow and some of the syntax is identical to what i know in react so it's a big help for me. It took me almost 5hrs to finish this. For improvements, I guess in terms of how i did it??
